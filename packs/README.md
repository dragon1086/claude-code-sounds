# Sound Pack Contribution Guide

**Contributions are very welcome.** Any theme, any language, any fandom — if it sounds good, we want it.

## Quick Start

Five steps from idea to merged PR:

1. Create `packs/<your-pack>/` with a `sounds/` subfolder
2. Drop in your audio files (`.wav` or `.mp3`)
3. Add a `pack.json`
4. Normalize audio to -20 LUFS
5. Open a PR — add your entry to [PACKS.md](../PACKS.md)

**Partial packs are supported.** You only need to include the events you want to override. Missing slots fall back to the `default` pack automatically.

## Audio Guidelines

### Normalize to -20 LUFS

All submissions must be normalized to **-20 LUFS** integrated loudness so volume is consistent across packs.

**Option 1 — use the included script** (recommended, handles two-pass loudnorm automatically):

```bash
python3 scripts/normalize_audio.py packs/my-pack/sounds/
```

**Option 2 — ffmpeg manually:**

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.wav -af "loudnorm=I=-20:TP=-1.5:LRA=11" output.wav
```

Batch convert a whole pack:

```bash
for dir in packs/my-pack/sounds/*/; do
  event=$(basename "$dir")
  mp3="$dir${event}.mp3"
  wav="$dir${event}.wav"
  [ -f "$mp3" ] && ffmpeg -y -i "$mp3" -af "loudnorm=I=-20:TP=-1.5:LRA=11" "$wav"
done
```

### Format

- `.wav` or `.mp3` — both work (`.wav` is tried first)
- Recommended: 44100 Hz, stereo or mono
- Keep clips short: 1–5 seconds is ideal

### Licensing

Only submit audio you have the right to distribute. Accepted licenses: MIT, CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC0, or equivalent. Add the license to `pack.json`.
